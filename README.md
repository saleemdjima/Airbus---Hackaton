# Airbus Hackathon
This repository contains the codebase for our deep learning model developed during the Airbus Hackathon in Marseille.

## Hackathon Objective: Helicopter Registration Number Detection and Recognition
The goal of this hackathon was to detect and recognize helicopter registration numbers from images. We used the YOLOv4 network for registration number detection, and EasyOCR for reading the detected numbers.
